### Day 0
Learnt about the Basics of Machine Learning and Understood the basic terms i.e. Feature, Labels, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Regressor, etc.

### Day 1
Installed sklearn and  understood some more term i.e. Testing, Training, Spillting, Linear and Multiple Regression, etc.

### Day 2
Created my First ML Regressor Model using sklearn and visulized it using matplotlib. You can have a look at code in [01_first_ml_model.py](01_first_ml_model.py)

### Day 3
Learnt about Loss Functions and Gradient Descent & understood how Linear Regression Model works by calculating Sum of Squared Error using Calculus

### Day 4
Understood Mini Batch and Stochastic Gradient Descent. Implemented KNeighbour Classifier to Iris Dataset. You can have a look at code in [02_kneighbour_classifier.py](02_kneighbour_classifier.py)

### Day 5
Understood How K Nearest Neighbor works, Overfitting, Underfitting and Logistic Regression

### Day 6
Created a ML Model for Logistic Regression using sklearn and visulized it using matplotlib. You can have a look at code in [03_logistic_regression.py](03_logistic_regression.py)

### Day 7
Completed Logistic Regression Model and started working on a fully fledged model using Boston Housing Dataset

### Day 8
